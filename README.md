> A curation of different checklists for testing and automation

A testers brain requires a lot of creativity and the no of scenarios that we test on a day to day basis are innumerable. Expecting the *brain* to remember all the ways of testing an application whether it be from a mobile, a web or an API interface is tough and an overhead.

These checklists are a brain dump of the different ways that I approach and think about testing apps in different conditions and hopefully reduces the cognitive load to remember these.

Hopefully these can give you inspiration to adapt and add more items for your needs as well.
